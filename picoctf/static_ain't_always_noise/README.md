## Description
> Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help!

# Solution
Reading the script (which btw is very well documented) and running it with the
appropriate argument renders two files: one with all the strings in the binary
and one with just the text section of the binaries.
Examining the strings from the binary we find the flag somewhere there.
